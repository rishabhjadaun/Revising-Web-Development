# Revising-Web-Development
In this repository, I'm going to upload anything regarding revision of web development I'm doing.

1. Done with HTML revision. Just briefly revised HTML and use some tags and things(links for different section of webpage, nested webpage, table with alternate rows with background color) for hands on feel.
